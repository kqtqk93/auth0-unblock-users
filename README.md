# Auth0 - Unblock Users

[![Auth0 Extensions](http://cdn.auth0.com/extensions/assets/badge.svg)](https://sandbox.it.auth0.com/api/run/auth0-extensions/extensions-badge?webtask_no_cache=1)

This extension will search the logs for the blocked users in your Auth0 tenant and unblock them after the configurable delay passes. 

## Best Practices

Keep <b>`UNBLOCK_DELAY`</b> reasonably long and monitor the blocked/unblocked users from logs. One way to do this is by exporting the Auth0 Logs to a third party Logging Service with one of [Auth0's Log extensions](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions#export-auth0-logs-to-an-external-service). 

In the 3rd party Logging Service, create alarms for frequent blocks for the same user. You can permanently block a user from Auth0 dashboard in such cases if required.

## Installation

* Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
* In the management dashboard [extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) section, enter your project's Github link in the opened window when you click <b>`+ CREATE EXTENSION`</b> button.Â 


## Configurable Options

 - `UNBLOCK_DELAY`: This allows you to set the period of time in minutes for blocked users to stay in blocked state. 

 - `START_FROM`: This allows you to set the log id for the extension to start. If unspecified extension cron job starts from the first log available and starts to unblock every user available in the logs. Note that if you have huge amount of logs when you install this extension and not set this option, it may take a few days for the extension to get to the edge of the logs. Until the extension runs in the edge of recent logs, it may not unblock recently blocked users accourding to your delay option. If you want extension to start unblocking recent blocked users immediately you may want to enter a log id of a recent log. Log id for a log can be extracted from the url. ![Alt text](images/log_url.png?raw=true "Log Id Image")

## Usage

Install the extension, and inspect unblocked users in the logs!


## How it works

This extension searches the logs with type `limit_wc` for blocked users. Once a log is found for a blocked user, extension first finds the user_id for the user and in the next step unblocks that user_id. Extension cron jobs runs with a configurable delay so any user blocked can be unblocked after the delay. Delay is set with `UNBLOCK_DELAY` parameter.

## Issue Reporting

If you have found a bug or if you have a feature request, please report them at this repository issues section. Please do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker. The [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/whitehat) details the procedure for disclosing security issues.

## Disclaimer

As the blocked users will be unblocked after the configured period with <b>`UNBLOCK_DELAY`</b> option , this could be an attack surface for hackers. By using this extension, you accept the risks it may cause.

* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
